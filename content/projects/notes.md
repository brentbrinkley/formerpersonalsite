title: Notes
description: >-
  Notes is a music language api that I've built several times most recently in
  Laravel. The structure may seem simple as it's a series of colors and shapes
  paired together via a Cartesian sum. But those colors and shapes represents a
  way to describe music theory thats never been done before.
